          <p>Product Manager at Mimo</p>
          <p>2018 - 2021</p>
          <p>Mimo has a custom learning management system on the web which I led the development efforts for. Some of the features I worked on were course management, access rights for internal/external contributors, and course engagement analytics
            for curriculum developers.</p>

          <h1>Community for Saving Money</h1>
          <p>Co-founder and CTO at Tip Yourself</p>
          <p>2015 - 2017</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/blue-sky/ct-tip-yourself-app-store-bsi-20160329-story.html" target="_blank">Tip Yourself</a> is a community of people motivating each others to save money. Each time you do something like make coffee at
            home or take the bus instead of driving, you "tip" yourself which moves money from your checking account into a virtual tip jar. If you choose to share the reason why, people in the community can see it and give you props.</p>
          <p>I led the development and launch of Tip Yourself, helping people save over $1,000,000 to pay down their credit card debt, student debt, and loans. Tip Yourself was aquired and integrated into <a href="https://www2.earnin.com/tipyourself/" target="_blank">Earnin</a>.</p>

          <h1>Photography Competition App</h1>
          <p>Founder at Apps by Lukas</p>
          <p>2014-2015</p>
          <p>Fraze Frame was a photo competition app where users up/down voted photos to determine who would win each weeks prize. The app does not exist on the App Store anymore.</p>
          <p>When I ran my app development company, I worked with a freelance designer and Android engineer to launch Fraze Frame's iOS, Android, and web apps.</p>

          <h1>Hacked News Services</h1>
          <p>Student at Florida State University</p>
          <p>2014</p>
          <p>During college I had very little money, but really enjoyed reading The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and USAToday. At the time, their subscription prices were extremely expensive compared to today. To avoid paying their hefty
            fees, I built an iOS and Android app to access articles for free from those news sites. The app was called News Hack.</p>
          <p>This project impressed a computer science professor who gave me my first contract for Apps by Lukas.</p>
