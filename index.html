        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I spend <em>a lot</em> of time learning things and found ways that work / ways that don't to pick up things fast. My main driver is <em>avoiding</em> things that stop learning momentum. Here's what I'm learning now:</p>
        <table class="table text-light">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Area of Learning</th>
              <th scope="col">Momentum killers I avoid</th>
              <th scope="col">Approach to Learning</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Developing High-Quality Software</th>
              <td>Useless meetings, tutorials, sticking to a single project/language</td>
              <td>Switching between three projects I'm interested in that people are actually using while getting feedback on code from senior developer friends. Applying to jobs where I can work with great engineers.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Latin Jazz Piano</th>
              <td>Classrooms, drilling a song in with sheet music</td>
              <td>Playing in noisy bars where I have to work to grab people's attention. Practice playing music by ear, changing songs when I get bored, and switching to dancing when my fingers hurt from playing/coding.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>My approach to getting better at what I do varies from the standard advice of specializing in one area, training yourself to work on , or going to a top school. However, it's led to making large contributions to two startup, Mimo and Tip Yourself, that I'm really proud of. (and I can play the piano)</p>
        <p>I'm betting the best is yet to come 🚀</p>

          <h3>My time at Mimo</h3>
          <p>I joined Mimo as employee #14 as a course engineer, creating their course Kotlin and Android Development. Within my first two months there, the company strategy shifted from supporting multiple courses in programming to going all-in on web development.</p>
          <p>The shift opened up opportunities to contribute to product changes on their mobile apps and I quickly found myself jumping back-and-forth between the curriculum team and a cross-functional team. My role shifted to diving deep into user research and analytics, allowing me to construct roadmaps and work with teams on execution to hit KPIs.</p>
          <p>During my time at Mimo, I facilitated the launch/iteration of four major features that enable millions of beginners to learn web development on their platform today. Learning paths (shown above), daily challenges, gamified practice, and mobile projects.</p>
          <h3>My favorite learning from building Mimo</h3>
          <p>The key to building a startup is momentum in the right direction. To build momentum is tough but the more you can remove roadblocks for teams and clear up where they should be heading, the more your teammates can take care of things themselves.</p>
          <p>A phrase I used at Mimo with the teams I worked with was “Never be the bottleneck”. The phrase still gets used at the startup today!</p>
          <p>Here are some things that I facilitated at Mimo that built momentum:
            <ul>
              <li>Organizing OKRs with the CEO and setting up Mixpanel/Metabase dashboards filled with KPIs for teams’ product areas.</li>
              <li>Architecting (and occasionally coding) changes to the learning management system and content packing, saving 2-4 developer days per sprint.</li>
              <li>Implemented a Basecamp-like development process that pushed as much product development ownership over to team members as I possibly could.</p></li>

          <h3>My time at Tip Yourself</h3>
          <p>During college I created an app development business called Apps by Lukas, where I built apps for people starting startups. The original founders of Tip Yourself, Mike Lenz and Sam Rodriguez approached me at a networking event in Chicago, where they hired me to build an idea they had for helping people build a habit of saving money.</p>
          <p>We started development right away with me focusing on the iOS app and another freelancer developing the backend.</p>
          <p>When we launched, the iOS app became a Top 20 Finance App, got featured in Oprah magazine, and got 30,000+ downloads within three months of launching. Sam and Mike were so impressed with the results, they asked me to join as a co-founder, where I eventually also took over backend development.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the app got bought by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/earnin-acquires-tip-yourself--f3ac923b">Earnin</a>, a financial service that helps lower-income individuals get an advance on their paycheck.</p>
          <h3>My favorite learning from building Tip Yourself</h3>
          <p>I was 21 at the time when I built Tip Yourself and had always thought of highly-regulated areas, like banking, as something that was impossible to build something for.</p>
          <p>It was amazing to develop a product that managed millions of dollars of people’s money and the experience gave me the confidence not to be afraid to tackle any kind of project. 
            Much more is possible than you initially might think, if you’re willing to put in the time to find a way.</p>
